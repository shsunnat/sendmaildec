## Gmail setup

 You must have two-factor authentication enabled on your Gmail account. If not, you should. We’ll have to generate a password 
 that Python script will use to log into your account and send emails.
It’s a straightforward step to do. Just click on this [URL](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords/), and you’ll be presented with a screen like this:

You won’t see the “Python Email” row, however. Just click on the Select app dropdown, and then on Other (Custom name). Enter a name (arbitrary), and click on the Generate button.

That’s it! A modal window like this will pop up:
